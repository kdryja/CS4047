\section{INTRODUCTION}

Bio-inspired computing is an ever-expanding area within computer science attempting to apply concepts that we observe in nature and in living organisms to modern algorithms in order to improve their efficiency and accuracy. The combination of efforts by scientists from different departments - such as biology (Genetic Algorithms) or sociology (Particle Swarm Optimisation) - enabled current techniques to learn from their mistakes and adapt to the changing circumstances \& environment. I strongly believe that introduction of such methods into our company would help us tackle problems such as stock prediction \cite{gunasekaran2011evaluation} or improving our current Machine Learning efforts - with the ultimate target of increasing the profit potential. In this report, I would like to bring our attention to two of the most common approaches: Artificial Immune Systems and Artificial Neural Networks, where I will explain the potential application and how useful they could be for our business.
